817. Linked List Components
We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
Example 2:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
Note:

If N is the length of the linked list given by head, 1 <= N <= 10000.
The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [0, N - 1].
1 <= G.length <= 10000.
G is a subset of all values in the linked list.

intuition:
we scanning through the link list, if node.val in G and node.next.val isn't including node.next is None this must be end of the connected point
if that certain node in linked list is by it self then it count as connected as well
